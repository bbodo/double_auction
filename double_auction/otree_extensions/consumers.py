        # Some ideas:
        # Each seller in the beginning has slots (like a deposit cells) filled with goods from his repo.
        # Each buyer also has empty slots (deposit cells) to fill in.
        # Each seller slot is associated with a certain cost of production.
        # Each buyer slot is associated with a certain value of owning the item in it (sounds strange)
        # buyer costs are associated with increasing cost of production (?)
        # seller values with diminishing marginal value
        # when two persons make a contract, an item is moved from  seller's cell to buyer's cell.
        # so an item has a location field. but
        # todo: check if market is not yet closed - if yes, send a signal to proceed for all players
        # todo: check if a buyer has money left. if not, send a signal so he can be forwarded to wp
        # todo: check if a seller has items in repository left. If not, send a signal so he can be forwarded to wp
        # todo: check if contract can be done. If yes, update repo and money for both seller and buyer. Send them
        # ... both some info regarding their repos to update corresponding containers, money/profit/ areas
        # todo: remove bids and asks of passive players (those who have no money or items to sell)
        # todo: validate correct price is inserted
        # todo: config quantity (more than 1 if settings are set for that)
        # TODO: slots for buyers
        # todo: syncrhonize timers among the entire group - via waitpage at the beginning
